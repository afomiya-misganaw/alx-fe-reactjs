# React Form Handling Demo

Compare two approaches to form handling in React: controlled components vs Formik.

## Quick Start

1. Place all files in a folder called `form-handling-react`
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## What's Included
